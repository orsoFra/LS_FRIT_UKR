In *notebooks/* we provide the two python notebooks for the reproduction of the results.

In *ids_fr.csv* and *ids_it.csv* we report all the ids of the comments of r/france and r/italy.
The dataset can be reconstructed utilizing the Pushshift dumps available on the-eye.eu. Be mindful that this could violate Reddit's ToS.
