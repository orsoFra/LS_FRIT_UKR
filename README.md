In the notebooks we provide the code for the reproduction of the results.

In *fr_ids_toxicity/sentiment.csv* and *it_ids_sentiment_toxicity.csv* we report all the ids of the comments of r/france and r/italy with toxicity and sentiment values.
The dataset can be fully reconstructed utilizing the Pushshift dumps available on the-eye.eu. Be mindful that this could violate Reddit's ToS.
