Repository for reproducibility of the paper: A Longitudinal Study of Italian and French Reddit Conversations Around the Russian Invasion of Ukraine. 

In notebooks/ we provide the two python notebooks for the reproduction of the results.

In ids_fr.csv and ids_it.csv we report all the ids of the comments of r/france and r/italy.
The dataset can be reconstructed utilizing the Pushshift dumps available on the-eye.eu. Be mindful that this could violate Reddit's ToS.
